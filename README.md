# Godot Procedural Generation

![project banner](./images/pcg-secrets.png)

Godot PCG (Procedural Content Generation) is a project to build a series of algorithms and demos to learn about procedural generation. The algorithms are from our course [Godot PCG Secrets](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/pcg-secrets-the-art-of-procedural-generation-in-godot).

## Available demos

The first release of this repository contains a Random Walker algorithm, as seen in Spelunky. This algorithm uses a node that walks randomly on a grid, places hand-designed level chunks, and randomizes them to generate unique levels.

## How to use

Clone the repository. Each demo is in a separate directory.

In the demos, we use a timer to show you the content generation steps, as the final level would otherwise appear instantly. Doing so helps to visualize and debug algorithms. Remove that timer code for the algorithm to run at full speed.
