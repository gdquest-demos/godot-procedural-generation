# Start project

This Godot project contains the files you'll need to follow along our course [Godot PCG Secrets](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/pcg-secrets-the-art-of-procedural-generation-in-godot).

It is included in the course's download, but like the rest of the code, we keep it this open-source code repository, to have everything in one place.
